    Quantum simulation involves using a quantum computer or simulator to model and analyze quantum systems. 
    It allows researchers to explore the behavior of quantum systems that may be too complex for classical computers to handle efficiently. 
    Quantum simulation has applications in various fields, including physics, chemistry, materials science (renewable energy material detection), and cryptography.

    st.write("""
    Qubits (quantum bits) are the basic units of quantum information. 
    Unlike classical bits, which can be either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in a superposition of states, 
    allowing them to represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously. 
    This property enables quantum computers to perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers.

    Quantum algorithms are algorithms designed to run on quantum computers. 
    They take advantage of the unique properties of qubits, such as superposition and entanglement, 
    to solve certain problems more efficiently than classical algorithms. 
    Some well-known quantum algorithms include Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases and 
    Shor's algorithm for integer factorization, which can break classical cryptographic protocols.

    Quantum operations are transformations applied to qubits to manipulate their states. 
    These operations include single-qubit gates, which act on individual qubits, and
